## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is `Consumer_Reviews_of_Amazon_Products_May19.csv`. It contains a comprehensive set of Amazon product reviews with 28,332 rows and 24 columns.

## Analysis Steps

### 1. Data Loading and Exploration
- Load the dataset and perform initial exploration to understand its structure.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize the distribution of reviews across different primary categories and ratings.

### 3. Sentiment Analysis
- Analyze negative, positive, and neutral feedback using word clouds and frequency analysis.

### 4. Text Preprocessing and Part-of-Speech Tagging
- Tokenize and tag text to analyze the structure of customer feedback.

### 5. Word Cloud Generation
- Generate word clouds to visualize common themes in different categories of feedback.

### 6. Bigram Analysis
- Perform bigram analysis to identify frequently occurring word pairs.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- NLTK
- WordCloud
- Scikit-learn

Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib nltk wordcloud scikit-learn
```

## Running the Analysis
